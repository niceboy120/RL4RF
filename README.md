# RL4RF: Reinforcement Learning Framework for Forex Trading (Code will be available after publication)

## Overview

RL4RF (Reinforcement Learning Framework for Forex Trading) is an open-source framework designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of reinforcement learning agents for forex trading. This framework provides a flexible and realistic environment for training and testing RL agents, allowing researchers and traders to explore and experiment with different trading strategies.

## Features

- Realistic Forex Trading Environment: RL4RF provides a realistic simulation of the Forex market, including key factors such as transaction costs, market volatility, and fundamental factors that influence exchange rates.

- Data Preprocessing: The framework includes data preprocessing steps to prepare raw market data for training RL agents.

- Diverse Data Sources: RL4RF offers data source diversity, enabling the study of various market scenarios by providing options to load data from CSV files, download data from the internet, and generate synthetic datasets.

- Extensible RL Algorithms: RL4RF integrates with popular reinforcement learning libraries like ElegantRL and Tianshoo, making it easy to experiment with a wide range of state-of-the-art RL algorithms.

- Flexible Architecture: The framework is highly extensible and can accommodate different RL algorithms and data sources, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced researchers.
